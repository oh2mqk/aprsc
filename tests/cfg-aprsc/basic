### Directories #########
# Data directory (for database files)
RunDir data

# Log directory
LogDir logs

### Intervals #########
# Interval specification format examples:
# 600 (600 seconds), 5m, 2h, 1h30m, 1d3h15m24s, etc...

# Statistics logging

# When no data is received from an upstream server in N seconds, switch to
# another server
UpstreamTimeout		10s

# When no data is received from a downstream server in N seconds, disconnect
ClientTimeout		48h

### TCP listener ##########
# Listen <socketname> <porttype> tcp <address to bind> <port>
#	socketname: any name you wish to show up in logs and statistics
#	porttype: one of:
#		fullfeed - everything, after dupe filtering
#		dupefeed - everything that comes in - with dupes!
#		msgonly - messages only
#		userfilter - user-specified filters
#
Listen "Messages only"                            messageonly tcp 0.0.0.0   1314   t/m
Listen "Full feed with CWOP"                      fullfeed    tcp 0.0.0.0  10152   t/c*
Listen "Igate port"                               igate       tcp 0.0.0.0  14580
Listen "Client-only port"                         clientonly  tcp 0.0.0.0  14581

### Internals ############
# Only use 3 threads in these basic tests, to keep startup/shutdown times
# short.
WorkerThreads 3

# When running this server as super-user, the server can (in many systems)
# increase several resource limits, and do other things that less privileged
# server can not do.
#
# The FileLimit is resource limit on how many simultaneous connections and
# some other internal resources the system can use at the same time.
# If the server is not being run as super-user, this setting has no effect.
#
FileLimit        10000
