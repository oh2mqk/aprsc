TODO ITEMS LIST

    - UDP communication
	- "Client" version exists -- unidirectional data flow from server to client,
	  server discards all data sent to it
	- Future todo:
	    - network performance buffering of data into UDP packets is needed
	    - client traffic flow in UDP form ?

    - complete output filters
	- s-filter is still missing

To Consider:

    - SCTP sockets

    - UDP with multiple messages in same datagram (up to about 1400 bytes
      in single UDP frame), AND with timestamp telling how long a message
      has been in transit, AND binary transparency capability...
      ( network byte order 32-bit value telling seconds since 2000-01-01 ? )
