Installing aprsc
================

aprsc is "officially" "supported" on the following platforms:

* Debian stable (6.0, "squeeze"): i386 and x86_64
* Ubuntu LTS (10.04, 12.04): i386 and x86_64

One or two other modern Linux distributions might become supported in the
near future, too.

If you're familiar with compiling software from the source code, and
your preferred operating system is not listed above, take a look at
BUILDING.md for documentation on building from source.

If you wish to have decent support, please pick Debian or Ubuntu. A number
of other Unix-like platforms do work, but when it comes to building and
installing, you're mostly on your own.
