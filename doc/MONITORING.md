Monitoring aprsc
================

It's a good practice to monitor the performance and utilisation of your
server, and to generate alarms when it's not working as it should.

aprsc comes with a munin plugin which makes it very easy to set up
statistics graphs.

Setting up the munin plugin
------------------------------

Install dependencies:

    apt-get install libcache-cache-perl libjson-xs-perl
