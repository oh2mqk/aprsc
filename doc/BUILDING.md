Compiling aprsc from source
===========================

If you're familiar with compiling software from the source code, and
pre-built binary packages are not available for your platform, this is where
you need to start.  Binary packages will be provided shortly for Debian and
Ubuntu systems.

aprsc has also been built and tested on:

* Debian 5.0 ("lenny"): i386 and x86_64
* Mac OS X 10.8 (Snow Leopard)
* FreeBSD 9.0 amd64
* Solaris 11 (SunOS 5.11 11.0 i86pc i386)

If you wish to have decent support, please pick Debian or Ubuntu. The other
platforms do work, but when it comes to building and installing, you're
mostly on your own.
