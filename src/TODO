TODO ITEMS LIST

    - Logins used on APRS-IS must not consist of exactly 8 characters from 0
      to 9 or A to F as this would indicate a server generated IP address
      for the q construct.

    - permit only one logged in socket from any given userid

    - core-peer communication

    - udp communication

    - complete output filters

    - timeout processing client vs. uplink vs. core vs. history dumpping client

    - global packet queue expiration  (done, but..)

    - remove the UPLINKSIM code (svn diff -r 99:100) before release and
      final testing

    - filter parse and error reporting for  aprsc.conf  defined filters
      (e.g.  "t/*" meaning "full feed"), sysadmin wants to see that info.

To Consider:

    - multiple parallel uplink connections, but send data on only one
      (resilient mesh) (CANNOT DO - will increase bandwidth on core servers
      if used with full feeds)

    - SCTP sockets

    - history dumps
	- Turn around the idea of worker scanning onwards the pbuf chain,
	  and feeding same pbuf to all clients -- new would be to scan clients,
	  and let each to forward the pbuf chain, and track the lag parameter.
	- This way each client can have multiple modes -- write() errno EAGAIN
	  is acceptable for history dump, while it is not so for regular feeds.
