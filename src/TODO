TODO ITEMS LIST

    - remove the UPLINKSIM code (svn diff -r 99:100) before release and
      final testing

    - permit only one logged in socket from any given userid

    - core-peer communication

    - udp communication

    - complete output filters

    - timeout processing client vs. uplink vs. core..

    - global packet queue expiration

    - history dumps

To Consider:

    - multiple parallel uplink connections, but send data on only one
      (resilient mesh) (CANNOT DO - will increase bandwidth on core servers
      if used with full feeds)

    - SCTP sockets
