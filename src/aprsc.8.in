The

Default is "aprsc.conf" in current directory.
.TP
.BI "\-f"
.br
.IR fork (2)
the program ro tun in the background.
.TP
.BI "\-n " logname

.I this
instance of the
.B aprsc
is known in the log.
Useful when you have multiple instances running.
.TP
.BI "\-r " log_dir
For file based logging, do it all in given directory.
There is no default log directory.
.TP
.BI "\-e " loglevel_token
The supported tokens are following with their corresponding priority values
.RI EMERG (0) ,
.RI ALERT (1) ,
.RI CRIT (2) ,
.RI ERROR (3) ,
.RI WARNING (4) ,
.RI NOTICE (5) ,
.RI INFO (6) ,
.RI DEBUG (7) .
This option defines a logging cutoff where events with higher numeric value
than the given cutoff are dropped internally.
The default cutoff is INFO.
.TP
.BI "\-o " logdestination_token
The supported tokens are following:
.IR none ,
.IR stderr ,
.IR syslog ", and"
.IR file .
.PP
.SH LOGGING

.TP
.B none
.br

.TP
.B stderr
.br
Log to stderr of the running users console session

.B "\-f"
is being used.
.TP
.B syslog
.br
Use
.IR syslog (3)
mechanism to send logging events to system
.IR syslogd (8),
When running under
.IR chroot (2)
this may require that the syslogd is configured to have log event receiving
named socket within that chroot area.
.TP
.B file
.br
The logging goes to configured directory using file names:
.IR aprsc.log ", and"
.IR aprsc.access.log .
which autorotate with up to N older versions,
each with M megabytes of size when the rotation happens.
Configuration of N and M is done with
